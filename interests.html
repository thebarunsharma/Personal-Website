		<h3>🎮Game Development</h3>
			<p>
				I love games. This was the reason for me to learn programming . When playing games all the time I thought what if I made that, how hard would it be? Then, I created my first game through PyGame which was also new as I didn't know python before. It was the classic Space Invaders game. 

				Then,  I created pong and flappy bird using turtle module. They were seemingly easy compared to the first one. After some months, I tried creating the *infamous* Flappy bird.
			</p>
		<h3>🎱Animation</h3>
			<p>
				Everybody in the Gen-Z have grown up watching cartoons and disney shows. It felt like the cartoon had life at that time (pop up [it does 😜]). I moved on to learning new Adobe Tool :Adobe Animate(previously known as flash). I started by learning basic squash and stretch and slowly moved on to the walk cycle, and have now reached to a point where I can make a character talk and move .
			</p>
		<h3>🎨Illustration</h3>
			<p>I've been using Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator for quite a while now. And I've always loved creating things in it , be it a basic character design, a 3D isometric city, hand lettering, avatars and logos. Again, Skillshare has been an amazing platform in delivering such quality content of rad creators around the globe.</p>
		<h3>🌐Web development</h3>
			<p>SkillShare was the platform which introduced me to web development. I took Rich Armstrong's classes and loved it. Definetly recommend watching at least one of the classes of that guy. He taught HTML | CSS like it was some sort of a game and he was quite amazing in explaining it. </p>
		<h3>📲App Development- Flutter</h3>
			<p>Post-COVID has been a interesting time period and I wanted to know what app development felt like. And when I started learning it, the immediate results in emulator/phone kept the coding spirit alive. Dart is a seemingly easy language and doesn't require much as Java but Java knowledge has been quite helpful in this case. And the knowledge of HTML|CSS was a plus point in making apps because dart too uses a grid for app dev.</p>
		<h3>📑SEO</h3>
			<p>What is second page of google a best place to hide a dead body? What comes up in the alignment of results when we search for anything in google? What is link-earning, SERP and on-page optimization? All this questions are answered by SEO. Taking <a href="https://www.skillshare.com/classes/Introduction-to-SEO-Tactics-and-Strategy-for-Entrepreneurs/681600915/projects" target="_blank">this</a>	 class by Rand Fishkin, I learnt what SEO meant and what effect it had on websites and it's tools and resources.</p>
