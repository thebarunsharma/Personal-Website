	<div id="bgs"><h2  >My Favourite Apps</h2>
		<h3 >Notion</h3>
			<p >It is the most flexible app I have ever used. It's mainly a note taking app but we can make Kanban style boards and calendars and also make *templates* . I use it to manage my life, studies. It can be also called as my *second brain.* I can switch from windows to Android and take all the college deadlines and assignments to information about running online courses.</p>
		<h3 >Anki</h3>
			<p >It is the best , minimal flashcard program out there. It syncs seamlessly with my phone and computer. I used it first for learning Spanish language which I am at a basic level now. And I used it for taking notes of short answers of Microprocessor in Third Semester. It is too satisfying to finish all the cards for the day.</p>
		<h3 >Spotify</h3>
			<p >This technically doesn't count as a app but I use it to listen to songs especially <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4ETfiRPHVmUFLF6q0g8Fux#_=_" target="_blank">The Ultimate Study Music Playlist</a> when I am studying or learning. I also use it when I'm working or coding.</p>
		<h3 >Google Keep</h3>
			<p >I use keep for taking notes for literally everything. From groceries to small journals, keep with it's minimalistic interface is easier to navigate through than other to-do apps.</p>
		<h3 >Wox and Quicklook</h3>
			<p >We all can agree that windows is more customizable than mac but the Mac OS is too damn good with small features to make workflow productive and effective. 

			For the alternative of Alfred on Mac, is Wox which launches a navigation toggle just by pressing Alt+ Space or the key you like. It is handy as windows' search bar is not so intuitive.

			This may little unnecessary so let‚Äôs use a good example. Let‚Äôs say we want to open a file. The ‚Äòordinary‚Äô  person‚Äôs way of opening the file on a Windows would be to use Search bar to locate the file and double-click it. However, if we look closer at this simple process, it takes quite a few steps.( Taking my Internet Technology labsheet as example)
			<ul >
				<li>Move the mouse to the bottom of the screen to the Windows button/ Press windows key.</li>
				<li>Type the file name</li>
				<li>Click/ press enter on the file if we find it there</li>
				<li>If you don't, go to This PC</li>
				<li>Click on search bar</li>
				<li>Type IT project</li>
				<li>Double-click on ‚ÄòIT ProjectBarun Sharma.pdf'</li>
			</ul>
			</p>			
			<p >This whole process of opening the file takes 10-15 seconds. In other words, there‚Äôs a 10-15 second lag between us thinking ‚ÄúI want to open this file‚Äù, and the file being open on the computer in front of us. Hence , wox can be helpful and same goes for the quicklook which helps to quick-preview a file by simply pressing Spacebar.</p>
